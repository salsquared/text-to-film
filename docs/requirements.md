## Overview
Text-to-Film is a tool for transforming text into film using AI agents that emulate film industry roles. Each agent is designed to either act like or assist people in specific film industry roles, providing insights and guidance for subsequent agents/models in the pipeline.

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Core Functionality
1. **Text Input Processing**
   - Accept text input (scripts, descriptions, narratives)
   - Parse and analyze text for key elements (scenes, characters, actions)

2. **AI Agent Pipeline**
   - Implement multiple AI agents representing different film roles
   - Enable sequential processing through the pipeline
   - Allow for feedback loops between agents

3. **Visual Output Generation**
   - Generate storyboards from text
   - Create visual assets based on descriptions
   - Produce video sequences from storyboards

4. **User Interface**
   - Document editor for text input
   - Project stages view to track progress
   - Image gallery/viewer for visual assets
   - Video player for final output

### 1.2 User Management
1. **Authentication**
   - User registration and login
   - Secure authentication system

2. **Project Management**
   - Create, save, and load projects
   - Track project history and versions
   - Export projects in various formats

- Image generation capabilities
- Video generation capabilities
- Agent communication protocol

### 2.4 Deployment Requirements
- Docker containerization
- Docker Compose for local development
- Environment configuration for development/production
- Database migration system

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- Responsive UI with minimal loading times
- Efficient processing of AI generation tasks
- Scalable backend to handle multiple concurrent users

### 3.2 Security
- Secure user authentication
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- API rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization

### 3.3 Usability
- Intuitive user interface
- Clear feedback on processing status
- Comprehensive documentation
- Helpful error messages

### 3.4 Scalability
